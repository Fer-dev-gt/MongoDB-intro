# MongoDB-intro
Here I created a Documents based DataBase to learn how to do basic and advanced queries with the most popular NoSQL DataBase, I also used the sample_training dataset provided by mongoDB. In this repo you'll be able to find the queries I used inside their respective folder, from how to create a Docker container from the terminal to some Aggregation Framework queries to answer more business oriented questions, CRUP operations, logic operators, upsert commands, use of RegEx to find particular data and more. Enjoy! üçÉüíª
